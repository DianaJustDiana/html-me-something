        <h1>Why I wear red plastic glasses that don't suit me</h1>
        <p>One of the joys of growing older is your body finds new ways to surprise you. For me, that's meant a transition from straight to curly hair, and from 20/20 vision to this:</p>

        <p>So last year I picked up a pair of cheap but decent-looking reading glasses. I'm not happy that I now need them, but at least this pair wasn't terrible.</p>

        <p>
        I had my trusty glasses with me on a recent trip to Costco. At any other store it would have been a quick trip, as I needed just one item, but Costco is where time stands still.</p>

        <!-- image of Costco checkout -->
        
        <p>Yeah. That checkout. I got in line, put on my glasses, and readied my credit card and Costco card.
        While I was waiting, I peered over the top of my glasses, and noticed, standing by the food court ...</p>

        <p>Hunky firefighters! Three of them! Three hunky firefighters! *</p>
        <!-- add image of the clouds parting and sunbeam shining through -->
        
        <p>At that very moment it was my turn in the checkout. Since I already had my glasses on, I was able to quickly punch in my payment information. 
        I started to head out, clutching my purse, my purchase, my keys, and my receipt. 
        But wait! I realized that I was about to stroll right past those firefighters.</p>

        <p>I quickly pushed my glasses up so they were perched atop my head.</p>

        <!--  image of old lady with glasses on her head -->

        <p>Nope, bad idea. Wearing reading glasses up there ages me by decades. So I took them off completely. I walked past the food court holding my purse, my purchase, my keys, my receipt, and also my glasses.</p>

        <!-- add image of hands holding too many things -->

        <p>I thought surely one of those firefighters would notice me and think, "Hmm. That woman with the giant box of vegetarian stuffed grape leaves and the blurry vision -- I must go talk to her!"</p>
        <!-- add some sort of image -->
        
        <p>Um, no. I walked all the way to the store exit, where an employee checked my receipt against my purchase, and then I walked outside to my car. 
        That's where I realized that not only had I not lured in a firefighter, I'd also managed to lose my glasses!</p>

        <!-- add image of D'oh! -->

        <p>It was time to retrace my steps. 
        I reversed my route and raced through the parking lot, back into the store (through the exit), and along the path to the checkout, searching for my stupid glasses.
        Those firefighters were still there, engrossed in their cheap hot dog lunch, but I didn't care. (If they weren't interested in the confident, glasses-free me, 
        they definitely weren't going to be interested in the panicked, searching-the-floor-for-glasses me.)</p>

        <p>I did not find my glasses.</p>

        <p>My next stop was the nearby Goodwill store, where I tried on every pair of decent-looking $3.69 reading glasses in stock, but those were all too strong for my eyes. 
        I settled on a pair that didn't appeal to me but made things less blurry.</p>

        <p>These days you'll see me wearing my red plastic replacement glasses -- also cheap, but not a style I like -- and when they're not on my face they're usually safely atop my head.</p>
