        <h1>How I lost my glasses</h1>
        <p>One of the joys of growing older is your body finds new ways to surprise you. For me, that's meant a transition from straight to curly hair, and from 20/20 vision to this:.</p>
        <!-- add image of something blurry here -->
        
        <p>So last year I picked up a pair of cheap but decent-looking reading glasses.</p> 
        <!-- add image of reading glasses -->
       
        <p>I'm not happy that I now need glasses, but at least this pair wasn't terrible.
        I had my trusty glasses with me on a recent trip to Costco. It should have been a quick trip, as I needed just one item, but there's nothing quick about this:</p>
        <!-- add image of Costco checkout -->
        
        <p>Yeah. That checkout. I got in line, put on my glasses, and readied my credit card and Costco card.
        While I was waiting, I peered over the top of my glasses, and noticed, standing by the food court ...</p>
        <!-- add image of Lego firefighters -->

        <p>Hunky firefighters! Three of them! Three hunky firefighters!</p>
        <!-- add image of the clouds parting and sunbeam shining through -->
        
        <p>At that very moment it was my turn in the checkout. Thanks to my glasses, I was able to quickly punch in my payment information and head out. 
        But wait! I realized that I was about to stroll right past those firefighters.
        I wouldn't garner their attention with my glasses on. So I quickly pushed my glasses up so they were perched atop my head.</p>
        <!-- add image of old lady with glasses on her head -->

        <p>Nope, bad idea. So I took them off completely. I walked past the food court holding my purchase, my keys, my receipt, my glasses, and my purse.</p>
        <!-- add image of hands holding too many things -->

        <p>As I strode past the food court, surely one of those firefighters would think, "Hmm. That woman with the giant box of vegetarian stuffed grape leaves and the blurry vision -- I must go talk to her!"</p>
        <!-- add some sort of image -->
        
        <p>Um, no. I walked all the way to the store exit, where an employee checked my receipt against my purchase, and then I walked outside to my car. 
        That's where I realized that not only did I not lure in a firefighter, I'd also lost my glasses!</p>
        <!-- add image of D'oh! -->

        <p>It was time to retrace my steps. 
        I walked through the parking lot, back into the store (through the exit), along the path to the checkout, and searched for my stupid glasses.
        Those inattentive firefighters were still there but I didn't care. (If they weren't interested in the confident, glasses-free me, 
        they definitely weren't going to be interested in the panicked, searching-the-floor-for-glasses me.)</p>

        <p>So that's my story. These days you'll see me wearing my replacement glasses -- also cheap, but not a style I like -- and when they're not on my face they're usually atop my head.</p>
