            <p>One of the joys of growing older is your body finds new ways to surprise you. For me, that's meant a transition from straight to curly hair, and from 20/20 vision to this:</p>
            <figure class="vertical-pics">

            <p>So last year I picked up a pair of cheap but decent-looking reading glasses. I'm not happy that I now need them, but at least this pair wasn't terrible.</p> 
            <figure>

            <p>I had my trusty glasses with me on a recent trip to Costco. At any other store it would have been a quick trip, as I needed just one item, but Costco is where time stands still.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/costco-checkout-lines-cropped.jpg" alt:"long lines to check out at Costco">
                <figcaption>Yeah. That checkout.</figcaption>
            </figure>
                
            <p>I got in line and readied my credit and Costco cards. While I was waiting, I peered over the top of my glasses and noticed, standing by the food court ...</p>
            
            <p>Hunky firefighters! Three of them! Three hunky firefighters! (Click the button if you can handle the sight of THREE! HUNKY! FIREFIGHTERS!)</p>
            

            <button onclick="w3.toggleShow('#spoiler-box')">Show me the beefcake</button>

            </figure>
            
            <p>At that very moment it was my turn in the checkout. Since I already had my glasses on, I was able to quickly punch in my payment information. Done! I started toward the exit, clutching my purse, my purchase, my keys, and my receipt. But wait! I realized that I was about to stroll right past those firefighters. Then I remembered the famous Dorothy Parker quote:</p>
            <figure class="vertical-pics">
                <img src="images/dorothy-parker-quote-cropped.jpg" alt:"Dorothy Parker quote rendered in cross stitch: Men seldom make passes at girls who wear glasses.">
            </figure>
            
            <p>I quickly pushed my glasses up so they were perched atop my head.</p>
            <figure class="vertical-pics">
                <img src="images/older-woman-with-readers-on-head.jpg" alt:"senior citizen with reading glasses on top of head">
                <figcaption>No shade toward the woman in this stock photo. She looks great, but she also has a couple of decades on me.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            
            <p>Nope. Wearing reading glasses up there makes me look like a retiree. So I took them off completely. I walked past the food court holding my purse, my purchase, my keys, my receipt, and also my glasses.</p>

            <p>I thought surely one of those firefighters would notice me and think, "Hey, that woman with the giant box of vegetarian stuffed grape leaves and the blurry vision -- I must go talk to her!"</p>
        
            <p>Um, no. I walked all the way to the store exit, and then outside to my car. 
            That's where I realized that not only had I failed to lure in a firefighter, I'd also managed to lose my glasses!</p>

            </figure>
            
            <p>It was time to retrace my steps. 
            I reversed my route and raced through the parking lot, back into the store (through the exit), and along the path to the checkout, searching blindly for my stupid @#$%ing glasses.
            Those firefighters were still there, engrossed in their cheap hot dog lunch, but I didn't care. (If they weren't interested in the confident, glasses-free me, 
            they definitely weren't going to be interested in the panicked, searching-the-floor-for-glasses me.)</p>

            </figure>
            
            <p>I did not find my glasses.</p>

            <p>After Costco I stopped at the nearby Goodwill store, where I tried on every pair of decent-looking $3.69 reading glasses in stock, but those were all too strong for my eyes. 
            I settled on a pair that didn't appeal to me but made things less blurry:</p>

            </figure>
            
            <p>These days you'll see me wearing my red plastic replacement glasses, and when they're not on my face they're usually safely atop my head.</p>
